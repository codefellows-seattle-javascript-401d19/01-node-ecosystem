In arithmetic.js I am exporting an object called Arithmetic. The arithmetic.js .sum function has an arity of two (numberOne and numberTwo). These two inputs must be numbers. If they are not numbers then null will be returned. If they are numbers then the sum of their values will be added and returned. The arithmetic.js .sub function has an arity of two (numberOne and numberTwo). These two inputs must also be numbers. If they are not numbers then null will be returned. If they are numbers then the second parameter will be subtracted from the first and the value returned.


In greet.js I am exporting an object called Greet. The greet.js .hello function has an arity of one that accepts a string as input (in our case a name) and returns Hello, <whatever string input is given>. If the input is not a string or is '' then it returns null.
