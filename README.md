#The# exported values in my greet.JS module is a single "string" unless a non string is input which will result in returning "null". This would be considered as having only ONE "arity". My expected data was "Hello, World!"

The exported values in my "arithmetic.JS" module is the sum and the difference between two numbers unless a NON Number(NaN) is input which will result in returning "null". This would be considered as having sn "arity" of TWO. My expected data from ADD was the SUM of 10 and 5 which is 15 and from SUBTRACT I expected the difference of two numbers 10 and 5 which is 5.
