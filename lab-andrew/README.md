## Exported objects

I am exporting an object named Greet out of the greet.js file, and an object named Arithmetic out of the arithmetic.js file.

### Methods

#### Greet
The Greet object has one method which is named hello. It has an arity of 1, it takes an parameter <name> which must be a string, and it will return 'hello <name>'. If <name> is not a string it will return null.

#### Arithmetic
The Arithmetic object has two methods, an add method and a sub method. They both have an arity of 2. Both arguments must be numbers, or else the function will return null. The add method will add the two numbers together, and the sub method will subtract the second argument from the first.
