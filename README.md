## In my lib, I created two files, arithmetic and greet.

## Arithmetic includes functions for addition and subtraction.

## Both addition and subtraction take in two parameters and return either the two parameters added or subtracted from one another, the latter subtracting the second paramter from the first.  With correct behavior, they return a data type of number and incorrect behavior will return a null data type.

## Greet includes a function that takes in one parameter, the user's name (or something creative such as world).  With correct behavior, the function returns a concatenated string of 'Hello <name>!' and incorrect behavior (i.e. an entry of an empty string or a non-string datatype) returns null.
